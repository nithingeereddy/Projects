     <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>The patient appointment management app is a web-based system designed to streamline the process of scheduling and managing patient appointments for healthcare providers. Built using JSP (JavaServer Pages) and Servlets, the app allows users to input patient data, including personal information and appointment preferences.

Upon submission, the app processes the data and schedules the appointment accordingly. It provides features such as viewing existing appointments, editing or canceling appointments, and sending reminders to patients. The app aims to improve the overall efficiency of appointment booking and management, ensuring a smoother experience for both healthcare providers and patients.</p>
